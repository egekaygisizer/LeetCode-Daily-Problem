# Problem 2570: Merge Two 2D Arrays by Summing Values  

## Problem Description  
You are given two 2D integer arrays nums1 and nums2.

- `nums1[i] = [idi, vali] indicate that the number with the id idi has a value equal to vali.`
- `nums2[i] = [idi, vali] indicate that the number with the id idi has a value equal to vali.`

Each array contains unique ids and is sorted in ascending order by id.

Merge the two arrays into one array that is sorted in ascending order by id, respecting the following conditions:

- Only ids that appear in at least one of the two arrays should be included in the resulting array.
- Each id should be included only once and its value should be the sum of the values of this id in the two arrays. If the id does not exist in one of the two arrays, then assume its value in that array to be 0.
Return the resulting array. The returned array must be sorted in ascending order by id. 


### Example 1  
**Input:**  
```plaintext
nums1 = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,5]], nums2 = [[1,4],[3,2],[4,1]]
```  
**Output:**  
```plaintext
[[1,6],[2,3],[3,2],[4,6]]
```  
**Explanation:**  
```plaintext
The resulting array contains the following:
- id = 1, the value of this id is 2 + 4 = 6.
- id = 2, the value of this id is 3.
- id = 3, the value of this id is 2.
- id = 4, the value of this id is 5 + 1 = 6.
```

## Approach

1. **Merge the Arrays**: Iterate through both `nums1` and `nums2`, comparing their elements to find common ids.
2. **Add Values of Common IDs**: For matching ids, sum their values from both arrays. If an id is present in only one array, take its value from that array.
3. **Sort the Result**: After merging and summing, sort the final result by id in ascending order.
4. **Return the Final Array**: Dynamically allocate the memory for the result array to ensure memory safety and avoid unnecessary overhead.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n + m)`, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`. The algorithm processes both arrays once to merge the values, and a sorting step ensures the array is in ascending order.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n + m)`, as we allocate a new array to store the merged and sorted result.

## Key Insights

- **Efficient Merging**: By processing both arrays same time, we avoid unuseless operations and ensure an efficient merge.
- **Memory Safety**: The result array is dynamically allocated, ensuring that memory is used optimally and safely.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The solution covers scenarios with no common ids, different array lengths, and cases where ids exist in only one array.
